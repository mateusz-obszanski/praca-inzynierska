# TODOs

- TODO MTSP matrix form
  - vertices don't repeat - draw which particular ones should change places
  - matrix has fixed size, -1s are scattered and ignored - this helps to define crossover
  - shuffle mutation - generate rectangular chunks (may be overlapping) of matrix
    values and swap them
- TODO MVMTSP matrix form
  - random change mutation
  - random swap mutation (with -1s or not - when deletion mutation is present?)
  - insertion (if possible - there is -1 in row)
  - deletion - replace with -1
- TODO
